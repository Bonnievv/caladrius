- Data collection bias
  - Data are collected from areas where people think disasters may occur
  - How it's done?
   - Census data / govt data
   - Drone data
- Data: 
 - Data before disaster
  - Taken in Feb last year
  - Map was updated from it
  - OSM was used
  - Remapped
  - 6k buildings + few kms of streets
 - Data after disaster
  - Blue tarps is a really good indicator
  - Data source is not sometimes aligned
 - Another type of data
  - Sateliile image from digital globe from before the hurricane
   - RGB -> HSL 
   - Both have been subtracted
   - difference map 
    - before - after
    - clouds!
   - all datasets have clouds
    - problem: buildings will show up as change
   - not all data is aligned
    - raw data
    - not lined up
   - qgis
    - realign
    - ground reference points
    - thin plate spline
     - different shifts of images
     - some are (x,y)
      - bends + 2 bends
      - thin plate spline
     - square cutouts
  - manual work to label all data
   - hurricane irma, maria
 - existing methods
  - existing method works very well on current dataset
  - doesn't generalize well
  - dan can point to the solution
   - ping him on slack
